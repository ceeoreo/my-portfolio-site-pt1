      <p>I was born and raised in Philadelphia. I have been interested in computer coding since the age of 12. I started to seriously begin pursuing learning how to code during my senior year of high school. I was able to attend Kode With Klossy during its Philadelphia debut in July of 2018. That experienced further motivated me to pursue computer coding.</p>
			<p> I am currently enrolled in the online coding school <a href="https://launchschool.com/"> Launch School</a> and I use coding platforms like <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> to suplement my learning. I am also currently taking digital marketing courses through <a href="https://genm.co/">GenM</a>. Through this top-notch educational platform, I have been able to pursue an apprenticeship for digital marketing. I'm excited to make my mark on the tech world! Stay tuned to see how I do that!</p>
